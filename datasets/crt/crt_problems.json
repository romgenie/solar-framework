    "question": "A bat and a ball cost .10 in total. The bat costs .00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?",

    "correct_answer": "download_datasets.sh.05",
    "explanation": "Let x be the cost of the ball. Then the bat costs x + .00. We have x + (x + .00) = .10, so 2x + .00 = .10, thus 2x = download_datasets.sh.10, and x = download_datasets.sh.05."
