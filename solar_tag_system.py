"""
This module implements the Topological-Annotation-Generation (TAG) System and Topological Tuning components 
of the SOLAR framework. The TAG system automates the following:

1. Data Generation:
   - Diverse Response Generation: Simulates generating responses for a given problem using different reasoning topologies (CoT, ToT, GoT).
   - Controlled Variation: Emulates varying parameters (e.g., maximum depth, number of children) for diversity.

2. Automatic Annotation:
   - Topo Label Assignment: Computes a continuous score [0,1] indicating the likelihood that a given topology leads to a correct answer.
   - Hard Label Assignment: Assigns a binary correctness indicator (1 if correct, 0 otherwise).

3. Problem Difficulty Segmentation:
   - Data-Driven Categorization: Uses the distribution of topo labels to classify problems as 'Easy', 'Medium', or 'Hard'.

4. Training Data Preparation:
   - Diversity Sampling: Ensures balanced representation across reasoning topologies.
   - Correct Answer Filtering: Retains only responses that are marked as correct.
   - Rejection Sampling: Filters out samples with low quality (e.g., low topo label).

5. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT):
   - Next Token Prediction Training: Simulated training process on the curated dataset.
   - LoRA-Based Adaptation: Represents efficient fine-tuning, simulated here by a placeholder.
