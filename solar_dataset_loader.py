Dataset loader for SOLAR framework benchmarks.

This module loads and prepares datasets from standard benchmarks:
- GSM8K (Grade School Math)
- AQUA-RAT (Algebra Question Answering with Rationales)
- LogiQA (Logical Reasoning)
- CRT (Cognitive Reflection Test)

Usage:
    from solar_dataset_loader import DatasetLoader
    
    # Initialize the loader
    loader = DatasetLoader()
    
    # Load a specific dataset
    gsm8k_problems = loader.load_gsm8k(sample_size=5)
    aqua_problems = loader.load_aqua_rat(sample_size=3)
    
    # Load all datasets organized by problem category
    benchmark_problems = loader.load_benchmark_problems(sample_size=2)
    
    # Access problems by category
    for problem in benchmark_problems["arithmetic"]:
        print(problem)
        
The datasets are used by the benchmark scripts to:
1. Generate benchmark problems for different reasoning topologies
2. Provide ground truth answers for verification
3. Organize problems by category for analysis

See datasets/README.md for more information about the benchmark datasets.
