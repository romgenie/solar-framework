"""
This module implements the Topological Rewarding component of the SOLAR framework.
It integrates multi-topology response generation and a multi-task topological reward model (M-TRM)
to dynamically select the optimal reasoning response at inference time.

Components included:
- ReasoningTopology (base class)
- ChainOfThought, TreeOfThought, GraphOfThought (specific topology implementations)
- MultiTaskTopologicalRewardModel (evaluates and ranks responses)
- InferencePipeline (integrates request handling, dynamic routing, and response aggregation)
