This module implements the Hybrid Scaling component of the SOLAR framework.
Hybrid Scaling combines training scaling (via Topological Tuning) with inference scaling

Components included:
- FineTunedModel: A simulated fine-tuned language model optimized through topological tuning.
- MultiTaskTopologicalRewardModel: Evaluates and assigns scores to responses generated by the fine-tuned model.
